## Introduction
  
**Batikan** is an AI-driven e-commerce application aimed at authenticating batik products through image recognition technology. Batikan empowers users to verify the authenticity of batik by scanning an item to identify its origins and specific motifs. In addition to authentication, the app offers a marketplace for purchasing genuine batik products, bypassing intermediaries and ensuring quality. Through Batikan, we aim to close the knowledge gap surrounding batik, educate younger consumers, and contribute to preserving Indonesia's cultural heritage. The projectâ€™s broader goal is to protect and sustain authentic Indonesian batik for future generations.
